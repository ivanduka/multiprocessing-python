Where circumstances require more detailed information in an ESA, see: i. Table A-2 – Filing Requirements for Biophysical Elements; or ii. Table A-3 – Filing Requirements for Socio- Economic Elements.

Describe and substantiate the methods used for any surveys, such as those pertaining to wildlife, fisheries, plants, species at risk or species of special status, soils, heritage resources or traditional land use, and for establishing the baseline setting for the atmospheric and acoustic environment. Applicants must consult with other expert federal, provincial or territorial departments and other relevant authorities on requirements for baseline information and methods. Describe the methods used to predict the effects of the project on the biophysical and socio-economic elements, and the effects of the environment on the project. Predict the effects associated with the proposed project, including those that could be caused by construction, operations, decommissioning or abandonment, as well as accidents and malfunctions. Also include effects the environment could have on the project. For those biophysical and socio- economic elements or their valued components that require further analysis (see Table A-1), provide the detailed information outlined in Tables A-2 and A-3. Describe the standard and project specific mitigation measures and their adequacy for addressing the project effects, or clearly reference specific sections of company manuals that provide mitigation measures. Ensure that referenced manuals are current and filed with the NEB. Ensure that commitments about mitigative measures will be communicated to field staff for implementation through an Environmental Protection Plan (EPP).</td>

Provide supporting evidence (e.g., references to scientific literature, field studies, local and traditional knowledge, previous environmental assessment and monitoring reports) for: information and data collected; <s></s>analysis completed; <s></s>conclusions reached; and <s></s>the extent of professional judgment or experience relied upon in meeting these <s></s>information requirements, and the rationale for that extent of reliance. Describe and substantiate the methods used for any surveys, such as those pertaining to wildlife, fisheries, plants, species at risk or species of special status, soils, heritage resources or traditional land use, and for establishing the baseline setting for the atmospheric and acoustic environment. Applicants must consult with other expert federal, provincial or territorial departments and other relevant authorities on requirements for baseline information and methods. Describe the methods used to predict the effects of the project on the biophysical and socio-economic elements, and the effects of the environment on the project. Predict the effects associated with the proposed project, including those that could be caused by construction, operations, decommissioning or abandonment, as well as accidents and malfunctions. Also include effects the environment could have on the project. For those biophysical and socio- economic elements or their valued components that require further analysis (see Table A-1), provide the detailed information outlined in Tables A-2 and A-3. Describe the standard and project specific mitigation measures and their adequacy for addressing the project effects, or clearly reference specific sections of company manuals that provide mitigation measures. Ensure that referenced manuals are current and filed with the NEB. Ensure that commitments about mitigative measures will be communicated to field staff for implementation through an Environmental Protection Plan (EPP).</td>

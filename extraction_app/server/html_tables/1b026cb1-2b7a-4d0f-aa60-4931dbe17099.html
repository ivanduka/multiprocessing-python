      <td>Filing Requirement Describe plans and measures to address potential effects of accidents and malfunctions during construction and operation of the project. After taking into account any appropriate mitigation measures, identify any remaining residual effects from the project. Describe the methods and criteria used to determine the significance of adverse effects, including defining the point at which any particular effect on a valued component is considered “significant”. Evaluate the significance of residual adverse environmental and socio-economic effects against the defined criteria. Evaluate the likelihood of significant, residual adverse environmental and socio-economic effects occurring and substantiate the conclusions made. Identify the valued components for which residual effects are predicted, and describe and justify the methods used to predict any residual effects. For each valued component where residual effects have been identified, describe and justify the spatial and temporal boundaries used to assess the potential cumulative effects. Identify other physical works or activities that have been or will be carried out within the identified spatial and temporal boundaries for the cumulative effects assessment. Identify whether the effects of those physical works or activities that have been or will be carried out would be likely to produce effects on the valued components within the identified boundaries. Where other physical works or activities may affect the valued components for which residual effects from the applicant’s proposed project are predicted, continue the cumulative effects assessment, as follows: Consider the various components, phases and activities associated with the applicant’s <s></s>project that could interact with other physical work or activities. Provide a description of the extent of the cumulative effects on valued components. <s></s><s>Where professional knowledge or experience is cited, explain the extent to which </s>professional knowledge or experience was relied upon and justify how the resulting <s>conclusions or decisions were reached</s>. Describe the general and specific mitigation measures, beyond project-specific mitigation already considered, that are technically and economically feasible to address any cumulative effects.</td>

      <td>Filing Requirement Describe plans and measures to address potential effects of accidents and malfunctions during construction and operation of the project. After taking into account any appropriate mitigation measures, identify any remaining residual effects from the project. Describe the methods and criteria used to determine the significance of adverse effects, including defining the point at which any particular effect on a valued component is considered “significant”. Evaluate the significance of residual adverse environmental and socio-economic effects against the defined criteria. Evaluate the likelihood of significant, residual adverse environmental and socio-economic effects occurring and substantiate the conclusions made. Identify the valued components for which residual effects are predicted, and describe and justify the methods used to predict any residual effects. For each valued component where residual effects have been identified, describe and justify the spatial and temporal boundaries used to assess the potential cumulative effects. Identify other physical works or activities that have been or will be carried out within the identified spatial and temporal boundaries for the cumulative effects assessment. Identify whether the effects of those physical works or activities that have been or will be carried out would be likely to produce effects on the valued components within the identified boundaries. Where other physical works or activities may affect the valued components for which residual effects from the applicant’s proposed project are predicted, continue the cumulative effects assessment, as follows: Consider the various components, phases and activities associated with the applicant’s <s></s>project that could interact with other physical work or activities.

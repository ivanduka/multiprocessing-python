      <td>Identify and describe the current biophysical and socio-economic setting of each element \n(i.e., baseline information) in the area where the project is to be carried out. \nDescribe which biophysical or socio- economic elements in the study area are of ecological, \neconomic or human importance and require more detailed analysis taking into account the \nresults of consultation (see Table A-1 for examples). Where circumstances require more \ndetailed information in an ESA, see: \ni. \nTable A-2 – Filing Requirements for Biophysical Elements; or \nii. \nTable A-3 – Filing Requirements for Socio- Economic Elements. \nProvide supporting evidence (e.g., references to scientific literature, field studies, local and \ntraditional knowledge, previous environmental assessment and monitoring reports) for: \ninformation and data collected; \n \nanalysis completed; \n \nconclusions reached; and \n \nthe extent of professional judgment or experience relied upon in meeting these \n \ninformation requirements, and the rationale for that extent of reliance. \nDescribe and substantiate the methods used for any surveys, such as those pertaining to \nwildlife, fisheries, plants, species at risk or species of special status, soils, heritage resources \nor traditional land use, and for establishing the baseline setting for the atmospheric and \nacoustic environment. \nApplicants must consult with other expert federal, provincial or territorial departments and \nother relevant authorities on requirements for baseline information and methods. \nDescribe the methods used to predict the effects of the project on the biophysical and socio-\neconomic elements, and the effects of the environment on the project. \nPredict the effects associated with the proposed project, including those that could be caused \nby construction, operations, decommissioning or abandonment, as well as accidents and \nmalfunctions. \nAlso include effects the environment could have on the project. For those biophysical and \nsocio- economic elements or their valued components that require further analysis (see \nTable A-1), provide the detailed information outlined in Tables A-2 and A-3. \nDescribe the standard and project specific mitigation measures and their adequacy for \naddressing the project effects, or clearly reference specific sections of company manuals that \nprovide mitigation measures. Ensure that referenced manuals are current and filed with the \nNEB. \nEnsure that commitments about mitigative measures will be communicated to field staff for \nimplementation through an Environmental Protection Plan (EPP).</td>

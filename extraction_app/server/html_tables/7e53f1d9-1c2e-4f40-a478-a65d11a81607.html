      <td>Filing Requirement \nDescribe plans and measures to address potential effects of accidents and malfunctions \nduring construction and operation of the project. \nAfter taking into account any appropriate mitigation measures, identify any remaining residual \neffects from the project. \nDescribe the methods and criteria used to determine the significance of adverse effects, \nincluding defining the point at which any particular effect on a valued component is considered \n“significant”. \nEvaluate the significance of residual adverse environmental and socio-economic effects \nagainst the defined criteria. \nEvaluate the likelihood of significant, residual adverse environmental and socio-economic \neffects occurring and substantiate the conclusions made. \nIdentify the valued components for which residual effects are predicted, and describe and \njustify the methods used to predict any residual effects. \nFor each valued component where residual effects have been identified, describe and justify \nthe spatial and temporal boundaries used to assess the potential cumulative effects. \nIdentify other physical works or activities that have been or will be carried out within the \nidentified spatial and temporal boundaries for the cumulative effects assessment. \nIdentify whether the effects of those physical works or activities that have been or will be \ncarried out would be likely to produce effects on the valued components within the identified \nboundaries. \nWhere other physical works or activities may affect the valued components for which residual \neffects from the applicant’s proposed project are predicted, continue the cumulative effects \nassessment, as follows: \nConsider the various components, phases and activities associated with the applicant’s \n \nproject that could interact with other physical work or activities. \nProvide a description of the extent of the cumulative effects on valued components. \n \n  Where professional knowledge or experience is cited, explain the extent to which \nprofessional knowledge or experience was relied upon and justify how the resulting \nconclusions or decisions were reached.  \nDescribe the general and specific mitigation measures, beyond project-specific mitigation \nalready considered, that are technically and economically feasible to address any cumulative \neffects.</td>

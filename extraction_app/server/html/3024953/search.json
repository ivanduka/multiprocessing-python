(Enbridge) submitted an application (the Application) to the National Energy Board (NEB) for approval to construct and operate the Line 10 Westover Segment Replacement Project (the Project). The Project consists of the construction and operation of approximately 35 km of 508.0 mm O.D. (NPS 20) replacement pipeline and the decommissioning in-place of approximately 32 km of 323.9 mm O.D. (NPS 12) of existing pipeline in southern Ontario from Enbridge’s existing Westover Terminal to the existing Nanticoke Junction Facility. The replacement pipeline will be constructed within a construction right-of-way (ROW) comprised of a permanent easement and temporary workspace. The existing Line 10 pipeline will be decommissioned and, in accordance with Canadian Standards Association (CSA) Z662-15, be cleaned, isolated, left in place, and will be subject to ongoing monitoring. The pipeline will be placed in either the existing easement or new easement acquired adjacent to the existing easement. Pending regulatory approval, construction is anticipated to commence in Q3 2017 and be in-service by Q1 2018. Enbridge commissioned CH2M HILL Energy Canada, Ltd. (CH2M) to prepare an Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment (ESA) in collaboration with Dillon Consulting Limited (Dillon), which was submitted to the NEB in association with the Application on December 4, 2015. 1.1 Objectives Since writing the ESA, additional work has been completed on the Project. On April 18, 2016, Enbridge filed an ESA Update outlining supplemental environmental survey information [Filing ID A4Z3Z4] and update to consultation and engagement activities [Filing ID A4Z3Z3]. On July 15, 2016, Enbridge filed a Project-specific Preliminary Environmental Protection Plan (EPP) and an updated Environmental Alignment Sheet (EAS) Package [Filing ID A5D8Y1 and A5D8Y2]. The EPP and EAS were prepared using routing information that was updated since the initial Application was filed in December 2015. The same updated routing information has been used to prepare this Supplemental ESA. A summary of the route revisions along the replacement pipeline route since the Application was filed is provided in Section 2.1 and detailed on Figures 1A to 1G. As such, the resource-specific measures provided in the EPP and EAS are inclusive of the updated routing information and are consistent with this Supplemental ESA. The objective of this document is to provide the NEB with supplemental information related to updates to the Project and ESA. Specifically, the intent of this document is to provide the following information: • A summary of changes to Project details regarding the proposed replacement pipeline and facilities (Section 2.0) • A summary of the environmental and socio-economic consultation and engagement activities conducted since March 2016 (Section 3.0) • A review of field-based information that has been collected since the ESA was filed (Section 4.0) • A summary of the environmental and socio-economic considerations resulting from changes to the Project details, ongoing consultation and engagement and results of 2016 environmental field surveys (Section 5.0) • An evaluation of the potential effects and cumulative effects assessment completed for the Project considering the changes to Project details, updated consultation and engagement, 2016 field studies, NEB Information Request commitments and changes to the proposed mitigation (Section 6.0) • An update on remaining supplemental field studies for the Project (Section 7.0).

Enbridge will continue to evaluate Project design and routing options as further consultation and Project design work are undertaken. As such, further route refinements may be warranted as a result ongoing Project planning (including consideration of the results of ongoing stakeholder consultation, Aboriginal engagement, and field surveys). Locations along the Line 10 replacement pipeline route are referred to by Kilometer Post (KP). KPs are numbered sequentially starting at KP 0.0 at the Westover Terminal and ending at KP 35.8, just beyond the existing Nanticoke Facility. KPs reported below, in the EAS [Filing ID A5D8Y2] and Resource-Specific Mitigation Tables (Appendix O of the EPP [Filing ID A5D8Y1]) have accounted for changes due to the route revisions listed below. A summary of each route revision, including the start and end points, and the rationale is provided in Table 2-1. Corresponding figures are provided in Figures 1A to 1G in Appendix 1. Table 2-1.

The Project Footprint (Footprint) is made up of the area directly disturbed by Project construction and clean-up activities, including associated physical works and activities (i.e., construction ROW, permanent facilities, temporary facilities, temporary workspace and additional temporary workspace). The need for an additional 2 m of temporary workspace associated with the construction ROW has been identified. As a result, it is anticipated that the construction ROW will typically be approximately 35 m wide, comprised of 10 m of permanent easement and 25 m of temporary workspace. A summary of the changes since the ESA was submitted (i.e., December 2015) in length and Footprint resulting from route revisions is provided in Table 2-2. Table 2-2. Summary of Changes in Length and Footprint Resulting from Route Revisions and Changes to Temporary Workspace Element Project Detail – December 2015 Project Detail – Current Total Replacement Pipeline Footprint 135 ha 162 ha Permanent Easement Footprint 36 ha 29 ha Temporary Workspace Footprint 99 ha 133 ha Total Replacement Pipeline Length Approximately 35 km Approximately 35.8 km 2.2 Permanent Facilities Permanent facilities associated with the Project remain the same as initially identified in Section 2.5 of the ESA submitted to the NEB in December 2015 [Filing ID A4W2R0]. 2.3 Temporary Infrastructure and Workspace In addition to revisions to temporary workspace associated with the construction ROW, ongoing Project planning has also identified the need for revisions to extra temporary workspace (e.g., equipment staging areas). As a result of the revisions, the area of temporary workspace associated with the Project is approximately 133 ha. Changes to temporary workspace are not considered route revisions and are therefore not discussed further. However, the changes to temporary workspace have been considered in the assessment of changes to the Project below, are currently depicted on the EAS filed in July 2016 and will be revised in the EAS Package issued prior to construction. 2.4 Line 10 Decommissioning A Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report was filed with the Application [Filing ID A4W2T9]. An updated Decommissioning Environmental Technical Report is provided in Appendix 3 and includes the following information. • Revised anticipated segmentation locations • Revised site-specific mitigation measures • Updated information regarding decommissioning treatment • Specified use of cut and cap as a means of segmenting the pipeline • Incorporation of land use assessment • Inclusion of decommissioning environmental alignment sheets A complete list of changes and associated rationale has been included as a concordance table in the revised report.
